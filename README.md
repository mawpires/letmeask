# Letmeask

This project was made by Rocketseat to help teach React and Typescript concepts in the Next Level Week event, where in 1 week we create and finish a project learning about some of the most popular technologies of web development and mobile. The objective of this app is to help people who need to deal with lots of questions and have to find a way to organize them all to reply, this includes teachers, streamers, etc.
